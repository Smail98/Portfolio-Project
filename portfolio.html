                            <h4><strong>Commands</strong></h4>
                            <li><strong>cd:</strong> allows for a change of directory. Its the same as changing folders on Windows.</li>
                            <li><strong>ls:</strong> allows to view or "list" the content of the directory you're in.</li>
                            <li><strong>find:</strong> is used to search for a specific file</li>
                            <li><strong>cat:</strong> allows you to display the content of a file or multiple files</li>
                            <li><strong>vi</strong> is the most popular text editor. It works across all platforms and distributions and is user-friendly. When entered with a filename, it pops up a new screen and has its own commands for editing.</li><br>

                            <h4><strong>User groups</strong></h4>
                            <p class="content-div">User authorization is divided into 2 levels: ownership and permission.</p>
                            <li><strong>user:</strong> A user is the owner of the file. By default, the person who created a file becomes its owner. Hence, a user is also sometimes called an owner.</li>
                            <li><strong>group:</strong> A user- group can contain multiple users. All users belonging to a group will have the same access permissions to the file.</li>
                            <li><strong>everybody else:</strong> Any other user who has access to a file. This person has neither created the file, nor he belongs to a usergroup who could own the file.</li>
                            <h4><strong>Permissions</strong></h4>
                            <li><strong>read:</strong> A user is the owner of the file. By default, the person who created a file becomes its owner. Hence, a user is also sometimes called an owner.</li>
                            <li><strong>write:</strong> A user- group can contain multiple users. All users belonging to a group will have the same access permissions to the file.</li>
                            <li><strong>execute:</strong> Any other user who has access to a file. This person has neither created the file, nor he belongs to a usergroup who could own the file.</li>

                            <p class="content-div">I learned Git this semester and it's one of the most useful things I have learned so far in class. It's essentially a version control system for tracking changes in a source code for software development. Its extremely practical when collaborating with other students on coding projects because it allows for a fully controlled exchange of information with a structure that allows every member to work on his own freely.
                                Github is a web-based hosting service for version control using GIT. It gives you distributed version control and source code management functionality of GIT. You can create a project repository and invite people to work on your project or keep it completely open so that anyone can access the files and work on some bits.</p>

                            <li><strong>Clone:</strong> a GIT repository that you can create a local copy of the code provided by the developer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Commit:</strong> an individual change to a file that other developers can see comments for.</li>
                            <li><strong>Push:</strong> pushes up changes to a remote repository.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pull:</strong>the ability for other developers to review changes made to file.</li>
                            <li><strong>Branch:</strong> manage timelines, especially when multiple people are working on the project. Each repository can have multiple branches.</li>
                            <li><strong>Merge:</strong> all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge.</li>

                            <p class ="content-div">I learned a lot about web interface design through css in this class. How to organize the content of a website based on divisions and boxes that each have properties such as position, border margin, text alignment, that are the building bocks of web design. Most website respect two different layouts to organize and display content. Also the golden-ratio Phi is used in design of simple responsive web pages. By diving each dimension of a divison with 1.618 the golden ratio can be achieved. It's used in paddings and width height dimensions.</p>

                            <li><strong>Z-layout:</strong>Creating a web page with the Z-Layout helps to create a visual hierarchy that people are likely to follow, making it a perfect layout option for post-click landing page designs. The human right goes from left to right, top to bottom.</li>
                            <li><strong>F-layout:</strong>The F-Pattern design works best for pages that are dense with text â€” like blog posts, search results pages, longer sales pages, etc.</li>
